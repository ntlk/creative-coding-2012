<p class="course_intro">Want to take over the world? First you need to command the internet. In this short course you'll get a taste of the common web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and learn some basic programming principles. I will show you how to get interesting data to work with and how to use data and network as your material. Pretty soon you will control <a href="/creative-coding-2012/lazers.html">robot cats that shoot rainbow lasers from their eyes</a>. Probably.</p>

<p class="after_course_intro">This site contains additional notes that are meant to be useful during the workshop and hopefully afterwards. This isn't the full course, though maybe I will write it up at some future date. Feel free to use it for whatever you like, the license is liberal, though please remember that any images are copyright of their respective authors.</p>
