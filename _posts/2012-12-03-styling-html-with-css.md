## Slides

You can download a [PDF version here](/creative-coding-2012/assets/creative_coding_2012_session_2_css.pdf).

## Box model

For a details run down of all the implications of modelling boxes in this way, have a look at [this article on CSS Tricks](http://css-tricks.com/the-css-box-model/).

## Sample website

You can [download sample website files][1] to play with - included are two html pages with some sample styles applied. Useful if you aren't exactly sure where to start and just want to poke things around first.

## Documentation

You've tried [DocHub][3] yesterday while looking up HTML tags and their attributes, but I find it evem more useful for looking up CSS properties.

## Dabblet

[Dabblet][2] lets you deal with a small fragment of your site in separation from everything else. Includes lots of useful little touches: live preview as you type and tooltips that help you visualise the code.
