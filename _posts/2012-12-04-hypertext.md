## Slides

You can download a [PDF version here](/assets/creative_coding_2012_session1_hypertext.pdf).

## Mozilla X-Ray Goggles

The bookmarklet can be found [here](http://hackasaurus.org/en-US/goggles/). We will use this little tool to start with, but will move on to using 

## A selection of HTML tags

I have used [Paul Robert Lloyd's Styleguide](http://paulrobertlloyd.com/about/styleguide/) as an example of common tags and what they are used for. The version prepared for this session can be found [here](/assets/styleguide.html).

## Documentation

[HTML5 Doctor](https://html5doctor.com/element-index/) has a comprehensive list of many tags with explanation what they are used for. Another good source of documentation is [DocHub](http://dochub.io/).

## Learning some more in your own time

Code Academy has some good [exercises that can help you become proficient at HTML](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/htmlcss) (and CSS, but we'll talk about it at the next session).

## History of HTML

If you're interested in history of HTML, and how it's evolved, I suggest Jeremy Keith's essay [The Design of HTML5](http://adactio.com/articles/1704/) or his talk at [fronteers](http://fronteers.nl/congres/2010/sessions/the-design-of-html5-jeremy-keith) (especially the beginning):

## More about HTML5

Mark Pilgrim put together a very [comprehensive guide to HTML5's new features](http://diveintohtml5.info/).

## The infrastructure

I'm not sure we will have the time to talk about it during any of the sessions, but this is important. The internet and the web aren't magical, they rely on physical infrastructure. Who owns it and who has control over it should interest you. I suggest starting with [James Bridle's essay](http://booktwo.org/notebook/secret-servers/).
