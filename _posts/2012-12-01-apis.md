## Why are APIs awesome

> APIs are the next generation’s cardboard box.

> Give a child a cardboard box, and she’ll make a house, a rocket, a horse, a fort, a car, a cave, an oven, a container, a hat, and eventually a crumpled mess.

> Give a developer an API, and she’ll make untold numbers of new forms of the functionality and content you’ve provided.

## HTTP requests

Remember we briefly talked about HTTP requests? Your browser makes them on your behalf every time you visit a webpage. But you don't need to use a browser to make one and get data back...

[Here is a good article](http://djce.org.uk/dumprequest) that can help you understand requests and their structure in a lot more detail. And [here's more on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol#Request_methods).

During the session I will show you what all this means in practice; we will use a tool called [hurl.it](http://hurl.it/) to inspect them and understand how you can make them and what to do with the response you receive.
